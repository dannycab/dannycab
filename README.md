# Hi, I'm Danny

I'm a professor in physics and computational science at Michigan State who works on educational issues. I'm an advocate for open educational resources, and you will find most of my class materials hosted here. I also contribute to computational physics and science teaching materials. My research team hosts their analysis codes here as well.
