# Hi, I'm Danny

I'm a professor in [physics](http://pa.msu.edu) and [computational science](http://cmse.msu.edu) at Michigan State who works on [educational issues](http://perl.natsci.msu.edu). I'm an advocate for open educational resources, and you will find most of my [class materials](http://dannycaballero.info/teaching/index.html) hosted here. I also contribute to computational physics and science teaching materials. My research team hosts their [analysis codes](https://github.com/learningmachineslab) here as well.
